Function Description
wcslen(const wchar_t* ws) Returns a value of type size_t that is the length of the 
wide character string ws that you pass as the argument. 
The length excludes the termination L'\0' character.
wcscpy(wchar_t* destination, 
 const wchar_t source)
Copies the wide character string source to the wide character string destination. The function returns source.
wcsncpy(wchar_t* destination, 
 const wchar_t source, size_t n)
Copies n characters from the wide character string 
source to the wide character string destination. 
If source contains less than n characters, destination
is padded with L'\0' characters. The function 
returns source.
wcscat(whar_t* ws1, 
 whar_t* ws2)
Appends a copy of ws2 to ws1. The first character of ws2
overwrites the terminating null at the end of ws1. The 
function returns ws1.
wcsncmp(const wchar_t* ws1, 
 const wchar_t* ws2)
Compares the wide character string pointed to by ws1
with the wide character string pointed to by ws2 and 
returns a value of type int that is less than, equal to, or 
greater than 0 if the string ws1 is less than, equal to, 
or greater than the string ws2.
wcscmp(const wchar_t* ws1, 
 const wchar_t* ws2, size_t n)
Compares up to n characters from the wide character 
string pointed to by ws1 with the wide character string 
pointed to by ws2. The function returns a value of type 
int that is less than, equal to, or greater than 0 if the 
string of up to n characters from ws1 is less than, equal 
to, or greater than the string of up to n characters 
from ws2.
wcschr(const wchar_t* ws, 
 wchar_t wc)
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the wide 
character, wc, in the wide character string pointed to 
by ws. If wc is not found in ws, the NULL pointer value 
is returned.
wcsstr(const wchar_t* ws1, 
 const wchar_t* ws2)
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the wide 
character string ws2 in the wide character string ws1. 
If ws2 is not found in ws1, the NULL pointer value is 
returned.
